## 3. Challenging issues / Research and Solution / Result
This section demonstrates what was challenging issues, how to research them, and how to solve them

### Challenge #1 - Automating time-consuming battery power test
As a part of quality standard, our customer asked us to hand in certification reports guaranteeing the functional safety in a situation where battery voltage fluctuates, such as error messages in CAN communication, unexpected change of program variables, and initialization of HVAC controller. This work was quite time-consuming, since the type of voltage fluctuation was over 20 and input duration of each voltage fluctuation was too long. Thus, we needed to automate this time-consuming work to improve work efficiency.

### Research and Solution #1
**(Step 1)** Designed the concept for the automation of the battery power test<br>
**(Step 2)** Implemented VBA tool that generates DB files including time and voltage values<br>
**(Step 3)** Programmed application software that generates the fluctuation of voltage automatically with programmable power supply by Keysight company<br>
**(Step 4)** Set the environment of battery power test<br>
**(Step 5)** Evaluated the reported results <br>

**Fig.1)** shows the pulse generated by old programmable power supply. This supply can only generate limited voltage fluctuation. Thus, we couldn't deal with our customer requirement for more complex voltage fluctuation as shown in **Fig.2)**

Also, when our customer gave us an excel document that specified 21 scenarios of voltage fluctuation, there were too many raw data such as time and voltage values. Entering such a lot of raw data in software program was also time-consuming. So, I developed a software tool that generates DB files automatically by simply ding copy and paste the raw data in the tool through VBA programming. **Fig.3)** shows the software tool. These generated DB files are called in the software program of programmable power supply.
